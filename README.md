**Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI):**<br/>
The BCI system measures the activity of the central nervous system (CNS) and converts it into artificial output that alters, restores, enhances, supplements, or improves natural CNS output. The CNS is then able to interact with its external and internal environments in a different way.

**Steady State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP)**

SSVEP based BCI system must reflect flickering lights stimulus at different frequencies to the user. The best response for these stimulus are obtained for stimulation frequencies between 5 and 20 Hz. The response signals of these stimuli can be detected from the scalp. SSVEP based BCI systems analyze this signals.

In a biological visual system, the visual pathway starts with the retina and each unit has a corresponding function.

**Experimental setup**<br/>
For SSVEP stimulation, flash stimulus (F=13, 17, 21 Hz) technique has been chosen. The eight electrodes are placed according to the 10/20 system on Oz, O1, O2, POz, PO3, PO4, PO7 and PO8. The ground was placed on Fz and the reference was located on the right (or left) hear mastoid.

***Power Spectral Density Analysis (PSDA):*** The PSDA method is often used for SSVEP detection, which is related to frequency domain signal processing. The power spectral density analysis is implemented by calculating the signal/noise ratio based on the power densities around the stimulus frequencies
