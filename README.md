**Steady State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP)**

SSVEP based BCI system must reflect flickering lights stimulus at different frequencies to the user. The best response for these stimulus are obtained for stimulation frequencies between 5 and 20 Hz. The response signals of these stimuli can be detected from the scalp. SSVEP based BCI systems analyze this signals.

In a biological visual system, the visual pathway starts with the retina and each unit has a corresponding function.

**Experimental setup**<br/>
For SSVEP stimulation, flash stimulus (F=13, 17, 21 Hz) technique has been chosen. The eight electrodes are placed according to the 10/20 system on Oz, O1, O2, POz, PO3, PO4, PO7 and PO8. The ground was placed on Fz and the reference was located on the right (or left) hear mastoid.
