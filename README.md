**Steady State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP)**

SSVEP based BCI system must reflect flickering lights stimulus at different frequencies to the user. The best response for these stimulus are obtained for stimulation frequencies between 5 and 20 Hz. The response signals of these stimuli can be detected from the scalp. SSVEP based BCI systems analyze this signals.

In a biological visual system, the visual pathway starts with the retina and each unit has a corresponding function.
